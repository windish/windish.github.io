			<p>I'm Alja≈æ Vindi≈°, Slovene designer &amp; technologist.</p>
			<p>Having a mixed background in computer engineering and visual design has allowed me to explore their overlaps in human-computer interaction and the changing media landscape.</p>
			<p>I do custom metrics, visualisations and interfaces at <a href="http://3fs.si">3fs</a>. I also make news nerds out of journalism students at Faculty of social sciences, University of Ljubljana. Well, I try.</p>
			<p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windish/">the CV</a> will tell you, getting here has been hard, but lots of fun. There's even a <i>Best Map in Show</i> from Malofiej in there, if you happen to now what that is.</p>
			<p>I believe that data investigation and user participation are key to developing relevant products and services, as well as creating more informative and engaging content.</p>
			<p>So, <a href="mailto:contact@vindis.info">how can I help you?</a></p>
